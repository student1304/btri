About the project
=================

The Blockchain Technology Research Institute is a project of the Foundation for Fair Capital Markets. It is based in Frankfurt, Germany and conducts research with the objective to make blockchain technology usable and secure in order to connect the real economy with this exciting technology.
In this document you can find tutorials and instructions how to participate.

The project runs on an Ethereum based blockchain and will host several applications (DApps) to illustrate our research findings. Funding is provided by your donations to the foundation that will in turn comission the research. Please see the FAQ Section below on details and how to participate.

To play around with this the technology, you need some tools to get on the blockchain and see how easy it is.

FAQ Section
------------

Regarding the foundation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
**Q: Why use a foundation?**
	*A: The project is comissioned by a non-profit foundation to create publically available research about blockchain technology. This is to ensure that no funds are lost-in-translation and everything you donate goes towards the research project*

**Q: Where is the foundation?**
	*A: The foundation is located in Frankfurt, Germany and registered in under xxxxxxx.*

**Q: Is there a pre-sale and what is the bonus?**
	*A: .....*



Regarding the funding
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
**Q: When is the ICO?**
	*A: As we're asking for donations to a non-profit foundation, the process is different from known ICOs even when it looks quite similar, i.e. you send ETH and receive TOG. The foundation relies on ongoing funding and therefore donations can be made during relatively long windows that we'll keep open until the funding goal for each project is reached*


**Q: Why are you not selling tokens?**
	*A: The majority of ICOs seems to be designed to make money for the team running them. It is often unsure if and when anything will be produced, many even say not to expect any outcome. We take the honest approach and ask for a donation. This way you can be sure that all proceeds go into the research project to which you will have priority access*

**Q: Is there a hardcap?**
	*A: No. As we're not selling tokens with a story that the supply is limited and they can only increase in value, a hard cap is not necessary*

**Q: What is the price of a token?**
	*A: We will confirm a donation of every 1 ETH by sending you 100 TOG (Token-of-Gratitude) respectively*

**Q: What can I do with the TOG?**
	*A: You will have priority access to the research results. For larger contributions, you can formulate topics you would like to see researched. Get in touch with us (info@btri.de) if you're interested to comission your own research*





Regarding the tokens
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
**Q: What platform does the token run on?**
	*A: The Token-of-Gratitude TOG are ERC20 tokens and run on the Ethereum Main Chain*

**Q: Do you provide a marketplace for trading of the tokens?** 
	*A: No, we don't*

**Q: What is the token distribution?**
	*A: Every donation is matched with TOG at the rate of 1 ETH = 100 TOG. We will create new TOG for every future donation*

Regarding the project
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
**Q: I'm interested to try out the technology**
	*A: You will find a tutorial below how to play with the technology*

**Q: What stage of development is the project in and what is the future roadmap?**
	*A: xxxxx*

Getting connected to the Ethereum Blockchain
---------------------------------------------

Here you will learn how to connect to the Ethereum blockchain and set up an account. On the test network, we will provide your initial account balance to you can play around with it - no worries, we will show you step-by-step how it is done.

In summary, it's all quick and easy with the following steps:

* Install Metamask for your browser (Using Chrome highly recommended)
* Now you need to connect Metamask to the right blockchain. 

Install Metamask in Chrome Browser
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can follow this `video tutorial <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj9ztSdKSPU>`_ to add Metamask or alternatively - if you prefer text - then go `here <https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/>`_ .

Connect to our blockchain
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once Metamask is set-up, you need to connect to the BTRI-Testnet (our blockchain).
