About the project
=================

The Blockchain Technology Research Institute is a project of the Foundation for Fair Capital Markets, which is based in Frankfurt, Germany and conducts research with the objective to make blockchain technology usable and secure in order to connect the real economy with this exciting technology.
In this document you can find tutorials and instructions on how to participate through funding or commissioning individual  research.

Funding
^^^^^^^^
The foundation is seeking funding for Project No. 1 through donations. 
Project No. 1 will itself run on the Ethereum blockchain and confirm the receipt of your donations by issuing token-of-gratitude (TOG).
These tokens will also serve to identify supporters and grant preferred access to our research result.

The project will also generate several DApps on an Ethereum based blockchain to illustrate research findings.

To play around with this the technology, you need some tools to get on the blockchain and see how easy it is. Please refer to the *Setup* section to learn how to do this.
